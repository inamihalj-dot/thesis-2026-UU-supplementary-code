## Original Example Code (External Contribution)

This folder contains a short example code snippet kindly provided by
Flavio Meliadò as an initial illustration of a synthetic reconstruction framework.

The code is included verbatim for transparency and attribution.
It was not used directly in the final reconstruction pipeline of this thesis.

All other code in this repository was developed independently by the author.
